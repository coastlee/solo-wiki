# Self-Directed (Solo) Play

Time for a stream of conscience!

## What is Self-Directed Play?

<Server Name> is a place where you can play Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition at your own leisure. While we have the typical [West Marches]() experience of joining up with a group of other adventurers and accomplishing some task under the direction and guide of a **Game Master**, we also have another style of gaming. It's called **self-directed**, or **solo**, play.

You have the opportunity to play whenever and however you like. One of the most challenging aspects about the tabletop hobby is finding a group to play with--and then managing to align everyone's schedules so that you _can_ play at the same time. Self-directed play enables you to bypass this challenge. You do not need a Game Master. You don't need other players. You just need yourself and your dice (or [Avrae]() in the case of our shared world server).

If you've ever played an MMORPG (massive multiplayer online roleplaying game), then the basic concept of <Server Name> shouldn't be too foreign to you. In MMORPGs, you, along with many other players, join the same shared world, fraught with danger, conflict, mystery, adventure, and more. You can run through the experience alone, or you can band with others to tackle more dangerous objectives. The world responds to your actions, both individually and collectively. This section of our documentation focuses on **running through this experience alone** and what that might look like.
